   - By installing Node.js, you also get npm, which is a command line executable for downloading and managing Node.js packages.
     - Check the version of Node.js and npm that you have installed by running `node -v` and `npm -v` from the command line/terminal
   - Be careful of conflicting with existing installations of Node.js on your machine!
